# Project Overview:
The Movie Database project was the final project for my Database Management class. The purpose of the project was to demonstrate our ability to create a database, queries, and an interface to access the database. The database itself includes about 6 tables that are used to provide data on specific movies and which streaming service they belong to. The UI interacts with the database and retrieves the data for the user.

# Features:
  - Back End SQL Database
  - User Interface to Query and Update the Database
  - Ability to find movies based on certain parameters
  - Ability to write a review for a movie and create a user profile
  - Ability to choose a random movie from a streaming service

# Setup & Installation:
Running: 
  - SQL Code: mysql DBMS_Project.sql then mysql data_inserts.sql (Must be in this Order)
  - Python Code: python movie_finder.py
Installations: 
  - Maria DB (any new version works)
  - All the code provided in the repository
  - Any installations needed to run python (cannot be python 3)
  - All libraries found in the python script

# Usage and Details:
  1. In the config.py file, enter your username, password, host name, and database name for the MariaDB server you're trying to use.
  2. On that same MariaDB Server, run the DBMS_Project.sql file and data_inserts.sql files (must be in that exact order)
  3. Run the movie_finder.py code in the same directory as config.py.
  4. Enjoy the Database :)
